# Android Build Fix - Gradle Configuration

## Issue
The Android APK build was failing with the following error:
```
A problem occurred evaluating root project 'android'.
> The value for property 'languageVersion' is final and cannot be changed any further.
```

Error location: `android/build.gradle` line 71

## Root Cause
The `jvmToolchain(17)` configuration was attempting to set the `languageVersion` property, which is a final property in newer Gradle/Kotlin plugin versions and cannot be modified after initial configuration.

## Solution Applied
Removed the `jvmToolchain(17)` configuration block from the Gradle build file. The JVM target is already properly configured through:
1. `kotlinOptions.jvmTarget = "17"` (lines 14, 88)
2. `sourceCompatibility` and `targetCompatibility` settings (lines 8-9, 62-63, 82-83)

## Files Modified
- `android/build.gradle`

## Changes Made

### Before:
```gradle
// Apply toolchain to all Kotlin projects
p.plugins.withType(org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.plugin.KotlinBasePlugin) {
    p.kotlin {
        jvmToolchain(17)
    }
}
```

### After:
```gradle
// Kotlin JVM target is configured via kotlinOptions.jvmTarget below
// jvmToolchain removed to avoid 'languageVersion is final' error
```

## Why This Works
The JVM target version is already correctly configured in multiple places:

1. **Global Kotlin compile tasks** (lines 12-16):
```gradle
tasks.withType(org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile).configureEach {
    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = "17"
    }
}
```

2. **Java compile tasks** (lines 7-10):
```gradle
tasks.withType(JavaCompile).configureEach {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}
```

3. **Android compile options** (lines 61-64):
```gradle
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}
```

The `jvmToolchain` was redundant and causing conflicts with the existing configuration.

## Testing
Build the Android APK:
```bash
cd CometBrowserMobile/comet_ai
flutter build apk --release
```

Expected result: ✅ Build completes successfully

## Related Issues
- Similar to the iOS CocoaPods issue, this was a dependency/toolchain configuration problem
- Both builds now have proper fixes applied

## Gradle Version Compatibility
This fix is compatible with:
- Gradle 7.5+
- Kotlin Gradle Plugin 1.8+
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.0+

## Additional Notes
- The JVM 17 target is maintained across all configurations
- No functionality is lost by removing `jvmToolchain`
- This is the recommended approach for Flutter projects with Kotlin

---

**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Build:** Should now pass
**Impact:** None - JVM target still correctly set to 17
