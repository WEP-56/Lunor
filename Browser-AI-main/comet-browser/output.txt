I'm unable to resolve the build error `TypeError: m.default.useSyncExternalStore is not a function`.

Despite updating `next` to `^14.0.0` and `react` to `^18.0.0` in `package.json`, and performing aggressive cleaning of `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` followed by `npm install`, the `next build` command continues to execute `Next.js 16.1.1`.

This consistently points to an issue where the `next` executable being run is not the one specified in the `comet-browser`'s `package.json`. It is highly probable that `Next.js 16.1.1` is being inherited from a higher-level `node_modules` or `package-lock.json` in the monorepo structure (`C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Projects\AI-BROWSER\Browser-AI`).

Since my operational scope is limited to the `C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Projects\AI-BROWSER\Browser-AI\comet-browser` directory, I cannot directly access or modify files in the parent directories (like `C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Projects\AI-BROWSER\Browser-AI\node_modules` or `C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Projects\AI-BROWSER\Browser-AI\package-lock.json`). This prevents me from resolving the underlying dependency conflict that is causing the incorrect `next` version to be used.

To fix this, you would likely need to:
1.  Navigate to the root of your monorepo (`C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Projects\AI-BROWSER\Browser-AI`).
2.  Inspect its `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for the `next` dependency.
3.  Ensure that the `next` version across the entire monorepo is consistent and compatible with the React version you intend to use (e.g., `next@^14.0.0` with `react@^18.0.0`).
4.  Perform a clean install (`rm -r node_modules && rm package-lock.json && npm install`) from the monorepo root.

Without the ability to perform these actions at the monorepo root, I am unable to proceed further with this specific issue.
